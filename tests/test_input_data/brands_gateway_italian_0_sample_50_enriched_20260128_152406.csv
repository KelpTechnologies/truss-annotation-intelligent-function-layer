While 'pink' can be a color, in the context of jewelry and accessories, 'rose-gold' is a specific material that is pinkish in hue. Given the available options, 'Rose-gold' (ID 36) is a strong candidate. However, the title also mentions 'lente a specchio rosa' which translates to 'pink mirror lens'. This suggests that 'rosa' is referring to the color of the lens, not necessarily the hardware material. Without explicit mention of 'rose-gold' or a similar material for the hardware, and considering 'Gold' (ID 9) is a more general and common hardware material for luxury brands like PRADA, it's a safer and more direct match if the hardware is gold-toned. If the hardware is indeed rose-gold, the title is ambiguous. Given the ambiguity and the presence of 'Gold' as a general hardware material, I will prioritize 'Gold' as a potential primary material if the hardware is gold-toned. However, if the intention was rose-gold, the title is not precise enough. Re-evaluating, the prompt asks for the *most detailed* material. 'Rose-gold' is more detailed than 'Gold'. If the 'rosa' is indeed referring to the hardware, then 'Rose-gold' is the best fit. Let's assume 'rosa' in the context of PRADA sunglasses could refer to rose-gold hardware. If it were just the lens color, it would be less likely to be mentioned in a way that could be confused with hardware. Therefore, I will select Rose-gold.",0.0,,No TRUSS_model_id available - skipping size classification
