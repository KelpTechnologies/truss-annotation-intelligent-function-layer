Among the available taxonomy IDs, ID 307 directly matches 'Jackie 1961'. While 'Jackie 1961 Tote' (ID 1036) exists, the input does not specify 'Tote' as the shape. Following the classification logic, if a specific sub-model/shape is not present in the input, the parent core model ID is selected."

The description of leather aligns with the expected appearance of a high-end accessory like this wallet on chain, focusing on smooth texture, natural grain, and potential creasing.",307,Jackie 1961,1.0,"The input 'Jackie 1961 Wallet On Chain' has 'Jackie 1961' as the Core Model Name and 'Wallet On Chain' as the Sub-Model/Shape. No exact ID for 'Jackie 1961 Wallet On Chain' was found. Following the decision gate, it falls back to the parent Core Model 'Jackie 1961', which corresponds to ID 307."

Extracted 'Jackie' as the Core Model Name and 'Hobo' as the Sub-Model/Shape from the input 'Calfskin Bamboo Jackie Hobo'. 'Calfskin' and 'Bamboo' are treated as materials/features based on the priority hierarchy. 2. Scanned available models for 'Jackie'. Found 'ID 306: Jackie', 'ID 307: Jackie 1961', 'ID 308: Jackie Vintage', and 'ID 1036: Jackie 1961 Tote'. 3. No exact match for 'Jackie Hobo' was found in the taxonomy. 4. Following the classification logic, if no ID matches 'Core Name + Shape', but an ID matches the 'Core Name alone', that ID should be selected. 5. 'ID 306: Jackie' is the best match for the core model 'Jackie' when no specific shape variation is available. The 'Hard Match' rule prevents selecting 'Bamboo' (ID 50) as the core model, as it would contradict 'Jackie' being the primary core model in the input text."

Extracted Core Model Name from input 'Tessuto Zip Top Crossbody - AB': 'Tessuto' is identified as a material and must be ignored per instructions. 'Zip Top Crossbody' is a shape, not a core model name. Therefore, no Core Model Name could be extracted from the input. 2. Scanned available models: Since no Core Model Name was extracted from the input, no match could be found in the taxonomy. 3. Applied Classification Logic: As no ID matched a Core Model Name, the rule 'If NO ID matches the Core Name at all, return ID 0: unknown' was applied."

The taxonomy contains an exact match for this core model name: 'ID 1056: Soho Disco'. Although 'Crossbody' is present in the input, there is no more specific 'Soho Disco Crossbody' ID. Therefore, 'Soho Disco' (ID 1056) is the most precise match according to the classification logic, falling back to the direct model when a specific sub-variation is not explicitly listed."

'Tessuto' is identified as a material and is ignored per the hierarchy rules. The available taxonomy ID 212 'Double' is an exact match for the extracted core model name. Other potential models like 'Tessuto City' (ID 596) are not matched because the full core model name 'Tessuto City' is not present in the text, only the material 'Tessuto', which would contradict the taxonomy's core model name 'Tessuto City' by omission of 'City', violating the 'Hard Match' rule."
